# RiceRocks v1.3
An asteroids clone called 'Rice Rocks' that I made in Fall of 2013 for an online Coursera course.

This was the final project for an online course offered by Rice University through Coursera. It is essentially an Asteroids clone,
though I added a few of my own original features to the project, namely an engine overheat system. To play it, you can use this URL: http://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user301_boqeEgXy7mGrcZb.py  - Works best in Google Chrome.
